Vast Yonder needed an updated website showcasing their various projects. The brief was for a strong minimal design that put emphasis on the striking images and video documenting their activations.

It has a dark monochromatic design with smokey greys that puts the vibrant images front and center. A looping video on the landing page conveys a mix of technology and art, communicating the mixture of technology and art projects in Vast Yonderâ€™s portfolio.

Built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub, I configured the website to work with Prose.io, allowing the client to edit and upload content from the browser.
